## Contribution guidelines

- After making changes, **run the test suite** with:

  Tests may fail if optional dependencies like `pytest` are missing; record the output in your PR.
- Keep commits focused and include a short summary of your changes.
- New Python code should follow basic PEP8 style.
- If you add new features, update the README with usage instructions.
