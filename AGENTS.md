Repository Guidelines
=====================

- After making changes, run `python -m pytest -q` and record whether it succeeds or fails in the PR description.
- If dependencies are missing and tests cannot run, note the failure but continue.
- Keep commits concise with clear messages.
- Summaries in PRs should mention key files changed and highlight any new features or modules.
